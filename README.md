# LRLtaskannotation
AI models often underperform on low-resource languages. This research explores AI-assisted annotation that supports—not replaces—human judgment. It proposes dynamic, context-aware interfaces that adapt to annotator expertise, task complexity, and model confidence, aiming to improve annotation quality and scalability with large language models.
